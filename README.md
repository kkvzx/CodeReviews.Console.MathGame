# Math Game
### Requirements:
- 4 basic operations (Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- The divisions should result on INTEGERS ONLY and dividends should go from 0 to 100.
   Example: Your app shouldn't present the division 7/2 to the user, since it doesn't result in an integer.
- User should be presented with a menu
- You should record previous games in a List and there should be an option in the menu for the user to visualize a history of previous games.
- You don't need to record results on a database. Once the program is closed the results will be deleted.
- Implement timer that tracks how much time it takes to finish the game
